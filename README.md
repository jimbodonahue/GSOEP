# GSOEP
Master's project using the German Socio-economic panel and a DFL decomposition

## Software: Stata
## Method: DiNardo-Fortin-Lemieux (DFL) decomposition
An extention of the Kitigawa (Oaxaca-Blinder) decomposition, this method creates a counterfactual of an individual's status if they were in another group. In this case, we calculated the wealth that a German woman would have, had she been a man with similar characteristics. We examined groups of variables, including education, family history, etc, and examined the importance of each as a component of overall wealth inequality.

This project was a reproduction of Eva Sierminska's paper [Examining the Gender Wealth Gap in Germany](https://ideas.repec.org/p/diw/diwsop/diw_sp115.html), with Joachim Frick and Markus Grabka.
